<br> &mdash; Unaware of product

### Not Personas Current Users 
Adding features to support an unknown persona could increase your market.

### Not Personas Non-Users
Non-Users are predicted as expected as they don't find the usefulness of your product.


## Evaluate Product Usage Analytics
Some of the most common trends 

1. What features or sections of your product are used and aren't used at all?
2. User session time of when the app is opened and actively used.
3. It is typical for user sessions to drop after launch steadily, but if the drastic or quick time ask Q&A.

&mdash; Are users not interested anymore?
<br> &mdash; Are they using a competitor's product?
<br> &mdash; Does the need no longer exist?


## Use Net Promoter Scores
Net promoter question: Would you recommend this product or service to someone else?
Answers will be evaluated on a scale of 1 - 10.
The result of the question is an index of -100 to +100.

### Net Promoter Scoring
#### Promoters (9-10):
Enthusiastic Fans will most likely promote to others.

#### Passives (7-8):
Satisfied users, most likely won't promote to others. Potential targets for competitors.

#### Detractors (6 and Lower):
Actively discouraging others from using your product or service. Can be harmful to your product's reputation.

### NPS (Net Promoter Scoring):
Is calculated by subtracting Defectors from your Promoters. Passives are ignored.
<br> &mdash; NPS 30 = Good
<br> &mdash; NPS 50 = Great
<br> &mdash; NPS 70 = Excellent


## Planning Product Updates
### Debt
1. Work required to keep the product up to date.
2. In many products, especially technology ones, with each release you incur work that needs to be done to keep the product modern and updated.
3. These features might not be user-facing and are often based on external factors.
Ex:
&mdash; For instance, your product might be built with an older version of components that are no longer available.
<br> &mdash; You need to refactor or adjust your product to work with newer components.
<br> &mdash; Your product could be built with a programming framework that has been upgraded, and now need to update the code base to work with the update.

These work items are debt that need to be addressed in order to keep your product ready for active development and new features.

Over time, the amount of technical debt builds and builds. At some point, you will probably need to address some of these issues.

Sometimes the technical debt is so high, that it's actually more resource effective to start entirely from scratch and build something new. This means that you will need to retire the current product and remove it from the market.
